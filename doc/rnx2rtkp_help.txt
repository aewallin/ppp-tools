$ rnx2rtkp -help > rnx2rtkp.txt

 usage: rnx2rtkp [option]... file file [...]

 Read RINEX OBS/NAV/GNAV/HNAV/CLK, SP3, SBAS message log files and ccompute 
 receiver (rover) positions and output position solutions.
 The first RINEX OBS file shall contain receiver (rover) observations. For the
 relative mode, the second RINEX OBS file shall contain reference
 (base station) receiver observations. At least one RINEX NAV/GNAV/HNAV
 file shall be included in input files. To use SP3 precise ephemeris, specify
 the path in the files. The extension of the SP3 file shall be .sp3 or .eph.
 All of the input file paths can include wild-cards (*). To avoid command
 line deployment of wild-cards, use "..." for paths with wild-cards.
 Command line options are as follows ([]:default). With -k option, the
 processing options are input from the configuration file. In this case,
 command line options precede options in the configuration file.
